# Working-w-Data-Attributes-

Use the `data-*` attribute to add data to a DOM node. You can get that data in JavaScript with a node's `dataset` property.

### Instruction:

Create a `data-attribute.js`in your lab folder and link it in your `index.html.` 

Open up `data-attribute.js` in VScode and work through the prompts.

Verify the DOM attributes are updating in your browser’s development tools (Elements Inspector). 

```jsx
/*
 * You Do: Work through the following prompts. Write your code below each
 * comment.
 */

// 1. Get all elements with a class of `.second` from the DOM and save them to
//    a variable. This will be a NodeList (which works just like an array).

// 2. Get the first item from the NodeList and save it to a variable.

// 3. Print the `dataset` property of the item from Step 2.

// 4. Add a `data-name` attribute to the HTML page for the first heading with
//    a class of second. The value of `data-name` should be your name. What
//    happens when you print the `dataset` property now?
```
